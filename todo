2. Refactor resource manager and component manager
    Resource manager:
        Manage lifetime of a resource (should own all resources)
        Resource
            Everything loaded from a file
        Manage Models, Sounds, Textures, etc
        Fetch assets by handle
        get_asset<AssetType>(asset_handle)

    Components manager:
        get all components for entity
        get all components by type
        get all entities with component set
            need to map component type -> list[entity]
                all keys of hashmap at component type
                dedupe with subsequent component types
            entity -> list[component]
                maybe dont need this
                how to check if entity has component
            entity, component_type -> component
                index component type and then entity hashmap to get component
                optionally returns none if entity does not have component
            component type -> list[component]
                all values of hashmap at component type
